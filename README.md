# Multi-Agent-LLaMA-Sentiment-Analysis-System
Built a three-agent LLaMA-based sentiment analysis system where each agent independently classifies reviews as Positive, Negative, or Neutral using structured prompts. Final predictions are generated via majority voting, and performance is evaluated against true labels to measure accuracy and improve robustness.
